            You may have tried diets that promised fast results. For a while, the weight shifted — but energy faded, cravings returned, and progress felt harder each time.

          <div className="pl-6 border-l-4 border-[#01609C] space-y-2">
            <p className="font-medium">Not because you lacked discipline.</p>

            At TheLifeCo, weight is seen as a signal — shaped by metabolism, stress, digestion, sleep, and emotional patterns. When these systems are restored, change no longer needs to be forced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your journey begins with medical insight, gentle detoxification, and nourishment designed to work with your body, not against it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-medium" style={{ color: '#01609C' }}>
            As balance returns, weight begins to respond naturally.
          </p>

          <p>
            And you leave with more than incredible results — you leave with clarity, trust in your body, and understanding you can carry into everyday life.
